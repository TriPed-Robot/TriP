  abstract       = {Recently, more and more hybrid robots have been designed to meet the increasing demand for a wide spectrum of applications. However, development of a general and systematic method for kinematic design and dynamic analysis for hybrid robots is rare. Most publications deal with the kinematic and dynamic issues for individual hybrid robots rather than any generalization. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel method for kinematic and dynamic modelling for a class of hybrid robots. First, a generic scheme for the kinematic design of a general hybrid robot mechanism is proposed. In this manner, the kinematic equation and the constraint equations for the robot class are derived in a generalized case. Second, in order to simplify the dynamic modelling and analysis of the complex hybrid robots, a Lemma about the analytical relationship among the generalized velocities of a hybrid robot system is proven in a generalized case as well. Last, examples of the kinematic and dynamic modelling of a newly designed hybrid robot are presented to demonstrate and validate the proposed method.},

  abstract = {{This paper presents a novel 4-DOF kinematotropic hybrid parallel manipulator. The topological structure allows for the realization of two translatory and two rotary output motions. Both the translations and rotations take place only in two orthogonal axes. The rotations are designed to possess the kinematotropic property, namely the output mobility of the manipulator can be changed while the topological structure remains invariable. In the process of the topological synthesis, two types of topological arrangements of the kinematotropic hybrid parallel manipulators are developed in the form of multiply moving platforms and subchains based on displacement group theory and mathematical logic. Kinematic modeling of the most feasible kinematotropic hybrid parallel manipulator is performed by obtaining its kinematic forward and inverse solutions and velocities. Suitable drive methods are also defined. At last, a prototype of the analyzed kinematotropic hybrid parallel manipulator is built to evaluate the feasibility of the developed design method, validate the kinematic modeling, and establish the manipulator’s kinematotropic properties.}},

The parallel module consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three non-identical legs. These legs are connected in a way that the combined effects of the three legs leadver-constrained mechanism with complex motion. This motion is defined as a simultaneous combination of rotation and translation. In this paper we propose symbolical methods that able to calculate all kinematic solutions and identify the acceptable one by adding analytical constraint on the disposition of legs of the parallel module.},

The robot workspace is computed and illustrated following the singularities analysis. The robot structure consists of two modules: the PARAMIS robot, and the new serial positioning module. The serial positioning module is used to obtain a mechanically fixed remote center of motion (RCM), enabling the structure to manipulate also active instruments. The new robot provides the necessary motion control to respect the particularities and restrictions of surgical applications. The detailed workspace analysis demonstrates the importance of the relative positioning between the robot and the patient. A constructive solution of the new serial module, the numerical results and conclusions from the performed simulations are described.},
