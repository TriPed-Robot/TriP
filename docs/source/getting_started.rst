The current release of the project can always be found on the python package index `PyPi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>`_ .
However, since another python package is already called trip, the package is called trip_kinematics.
The current stable release can be installed using:

::

    pip install trip_kinematics


Alternatively, the current development version can be downloaded using Github:

::

    git clone https://github.com/TriPed-Robot/TriP
    cd TriP
    pip install src/


For more information on how to use the library once installed visit the Tutorials or read 'How TriP models Robots'.
